# roverTDD

This project aims to create and move a mars rover. To be able to test it, one needs to run the code and call the endpoint with data in request body. 

Note1: Each time one calls the endpoint, a new rover is created. 
Note2: I had problems creating JaCoCo coverage report but I constantly check the coverage through IntelliJ.
